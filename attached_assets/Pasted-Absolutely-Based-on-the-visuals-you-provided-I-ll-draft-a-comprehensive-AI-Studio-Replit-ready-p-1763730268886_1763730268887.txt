🚀 Prompt: Upgrade the Workout Generation System (Inspired by Visual References)

⸻

Objective:
Use the provided visuals to reimagine and fully upgrade my current workout generation system. The goal is to make the experience more dynamic, personalized, and interactive—integrating features like real-time tracking, muscle targeting, data-driven recommendations, and gamified feedback.

⸻

🔧 Core Functional Requirements:

⸻

1. Interactive Muscle Heatmap System (Body View)
Inspired by Image 1 & 2
	•	Implement a dynamic muscle heatmap UI that updates based on:
	•	Which muscles were trained recently
	•	Muscle recovery status (color-coded)
	•	Active training frequency per body part
	•	Stats at top:
	•	Days since last workout
	•	Number of fresh muscle groups available
	•	Tap-to-filter: Tapping on a muscle group should show:
	•	Exercises targeting that group
	•	Recent performance
	•	Suggestions for next workout

⸻

2. Custom Muscle Targeting Selection
Inspired by Image 2
	•	During plan generation or manual workout build:
	•	Let users select focus areas (e.g., chest, glutes, quads, abs)
	•	Store preferences and train the AI to prioritize those zones
	•	Combine this with fatigue data to avoid overtraining

⸻

3. Schedule & Frequency Personalization
Inspired by Image 3
	•	Allow users to select training days (multi-select M–Sun)
	•	Allow users to choose workout duration per session:
	•	10–20, 20–30, 30–45, 45–60, 60–75, 75–90 min
	•	Use this data to dynamically structure:
	•	Weekly split (push/pull/legs, full body, etc.)
	•	Volume and intensity scaling

⸻

4. Equipment Personalization + Filtering
Inspired by Image 4
	•	Rebuild the equipment selection UI:
	•	Search bar
	•	Toggle switches for available equipment
	•	Icon + name for each piece
	•	AI should filter exercise library based on these selections
	•	Allow users to update this anytime from settings

⸻

5. AI Weight, Rep & Progression Suggestions
Inspired by Image 5
	•	After a few logged sessions, introduce smart AI suggestions:
	•	Auto-suggest weight based on previous best
	•	Adjust reps based on progress/fatigue
	•	Visual progression chart over time
	•	Add “Suggested → Did It” toggle to track effort and accuracy
	•	Store data for progressive overload recommendations

⸻

6. Workout Logging with Real-Time Inputs
Inspired by Image 6 & 7
	•	Include ability to:
	•	Log weight, reps, sets per exercise
	•	Add notes (e.g. “watch form” or “felt easy”)
	•	Track superset/rest-pause sets
	•	Dynamic suggestions:
	•	Auto-fill previous set values
	•	Allow “+ Add Set” functionality per exercise
	•	Add emojis/tags to rate each set (energy, form, etc.)

⸻

7. Rest Timer + 1RM Auto-Calc
Inspired by Image 8
	•	Implement custom rest timers:
	•	Predefined (30s, 60s, 90s, etc.)
	•	Custom duration
	•	Auto-start between sets
	•	One-Rep Max Calculator:
	•	Estimate 1RM using Epley or Brzycki formulas
	•	Display historical progress in 1RM per movement

⸻

8. Gamified Leaderboards & Performance Rankings
Inspired by Image 9
	•	Create daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboards:
	•	Sort by: total volume, consistency, streaks, XP
	•	Filter by: muscle group, exercise, gym location (optional)
	•	Encourage community engagement through:
	•	Badges for rank-ups
	•	Notifications when you pass a friend

⸻

9. Workout Summary & Performance Breakdown
Inspired by Image 10
	•	After workout completion, show:
	•	Duration
	•	Calories burned
	•	Reps completed
	•	Total weight lifted
	•	Exercise completion rate
	•	Progress % vs. previous sessions
	•	Add visual charts:
	•	Muscle usage
	•	Weight lifted over time
	•	Adherence to plan

⸻

🧠 Smart AI Behavior:
	•	Use the onboarding data to:
	•	Create personalized splits (e.g., 4-day push/pull/legs/core)
	•	Select difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
	•	Adapt load and rest times
	•	Log everything to Supabase per user_id
	•	Save all generated plans with an option to edit or regenerate

⸻

🔄 Optional Add-ons:
	•	Workout Drafts: Save unfinished workouts
	•	Import/Export Workouts: Upload PDF/image or export to PDF/email
	•	Swipe-to-Edit Workouts: Quickly swap exercises with alternatives
	•	Swipe to Log or Skip from main workout screen

⸻

📦 Backend Tables (Supabase):
	•	user_workout_plans: All generated/custom workouts
	•	user_workout_logs: Logged sessions
	•	exercise_catalog: All exercise data (linked to muscle group, equipment)
	•	equipment_list: Available gym gear
	•	leaderboard_stats: Tracks XP, volume, consistency
	•	user_preferences: Focus areas, preferred training style, restrictions

⸻

✅ Final Outcome:

A fully interactive, modern, personalized workout generation system with:
	•	Smart automation from onboarding
	•	Swappable components
	•	Data-driven recovery & targeting
	•	Progress tracking
	•	Engagement-based gamification
