Perfect — here’s a complete, modular AIStudio prompt that implements the Heat Map System using the recommended dual-placement approach:

⸻

✅ Prompt: Heat Map System (Mini on Home + Full on Progress)

⸻

Objective:
Implement a dynamic Heat Map System that visualizes user activity (workouts, meals, hydration) using a color-coded calendar interface.

Use a two-part UI strategy:
	•	📍 Mini Preview Heatmap on Home
	•	📈 Full Heatmap with Filters on Progress Tab

⸻

🔁 Heat Map Logic:

Each day is colored based on the user’s activity level:

Color	Meaning
⚫ Gray	No activity logged
🔴 Red	Low activity (1 item logged: workout OR food OR water)
🟠 Orange	Moderate activity (2 of 3 logged)
🟢 Green	Full day completed (all 3 logged)
💎 Diamond	Perfect day (hit macro goals, workout, hydration)
🟦 Blue	Intentional rest day (if user selects it)


⸻

🏠 HOME SCREEN VERSION: Mini Heat Map (7–14 Days)
	•	Position: Under welcome message or streak area
	•	Display a horizontal scrollable strip of the last 7–14 days
	•	Visualize each day with:
	•	Colored dot or small square
	•	Tap = open full Heat Map in Progress tab
	•	Include mini-legend icon:
e.g. 🟢 = All goals hit

Purpose: Visual cue to motivate daily consistency

⸻

📊 PROGRESS TAB VERSION: Full Heat Map Calendar
	•	Show full month view with square grid calendar (similar to GitHub heatmaps)
	•	Toggle filters to show:
	•	Workouts Only
	•	Nutrition Only
	•	Hydration Only
	•	All Combined (default)
	•	Tap on a day = open detailed activity log for that day
	•	Show summary below calendar:
	•	“This month: 22 active days, 6 green days, 2 perfect 💎 days”
	•	Add option to switch months (back 3–6 months)

⸻

🧠 Functionality to Include
	•	Tracks:
	•	workoutLogged (bool)
	•	mealsLogged (>= 2 meals)
	•	hydrationGoalMet (bool or %)
	•	macrosGoalMet (optional, for 💎)
	•	Backend stores data per day in new daily_activity_summary table:

{
  user_id: uuid,
  date: "2025-11-08",
  workout_logged: true,
  meals_logged: 3,
  water_intake_oz: 80,
  goal_water_oz: 100,
  hit_macros: true,
  is_rest_day: false
}


⸻

🔥 Gamification Integration:
	•	Logging 3+ green days = XP bonus
	•	Earn badge: “Green Week” for 7 consecutive green days
	•	💎 days count toward exclusive badge: “Perfectionist”
	•	Broken streak triggers Reignite Challenge
	•	Display current streak beneath the heatmap

⸻

🎨 Design Notes:
	•	Mobile-first layout
	•	Color palette should use vibrant but accessible shades
	•	Match app’s theme — green for success, red/yellow for alerts
	•	Add subtle animations on color change (e.g. pulse on streak continuation)
	•	Use tooltips or tap-hold to show what was completed on each day

⸻

🔧 Optional Features:
	•	Toggle on Home screen:
“Show heat map preview” [on/off] in user settings
	•	Export full heat map as PNG or PDF (under Progress tab)
	•	Add vertical bar chart below heat map to show:
	•	Weekly activity volume
	•	Hydration averages
	•	Macro adherence trend

⸻

Let me know if you’d like:
	•	Figma-ready wireframe prompt
	•	Supabase table schema for daily_activity_summary
	•	Frontend implementation code (React Native, Flutter, SwiftUI, etc.)

Ready to expand this into your full Progress & Habit UI!
