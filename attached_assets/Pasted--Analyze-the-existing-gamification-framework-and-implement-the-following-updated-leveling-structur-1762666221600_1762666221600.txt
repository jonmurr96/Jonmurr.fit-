🔁 Analyze the existing gamification framework and implement the following updated leveling structure and progression mechanics to enhance engagement, retention, and user addiction.

🎮 Level System Overhaul:
	1.	Replace the tier names (Beginner, Intermediate, etc.) with fitness-culture-aligned rank titles:

	•	Levels 1–10 → Newbie
	•	Levels 11–25 → Rookie
	•	Levels 26–40 → Unit
	•	Levels 41–60 → Gym Rat
	•	Levels 61–80 → Gym Addict
	•	Levels 81–100 → Bodybuilder

	2.	Always show both the rank and level together, like:

	•	"Rookie – Level 17" or "Gym Addict – Level 76"

	3.	Implement a total of 100 levels:

	•	Make early levels (1–10) fast and rewarding to encourage onboarding momentum.
	•	Scale difficulty and XP requirements progressively to make later levels feel like a grind.
	•	Use an exponential or polynomial XP curve (e.g., XP required = baseXP * level^1.3 or similar).

	4.	Add XP progress bar and animation to:

	•	Show progress visually after every XP-triggering action.
	•	Use haptic/vibration feedback on level-up (mobile).

	5.	Let each rank unlock tier-specific perks (modular system):

	•	UI color themes
	•	Badge variants
	•	Special workouts (e.g., Gym Addict levels unlock “Beast Mode” routines)
	•	Mystery rewards (see Loot System)

📈 Expand Reward Triggers:

Enhance XP triggers:
	•	+XP for using AI tools (workout or meal planning)
	•	+XP for using barcode scanner
	•	+XP bonus for completing full week of streaks (stackable)
	•	+XP for reaching macro goals 3+ days in a row

Use small random XP bonuses to trigger variable reward effects for psychological hooks.

🔥 Final Integration Instructions:
	•	Sync all XP, level, and title data to Supabase under a new user_gamification_profile table.
	•	Each entry includes:
	•	user_id
	•	xp_total
	•	level (1–100)
	•	rank_title (from above)
	•	streak_count
	•	longest_streak
	•	unlocked_perks[]
	•	Ensure that the leveling system works modularly with:
	•	Workout logs
	•	Meal logs
	•	Water logs
	•	Progress photo logs
	•	Daily challenge completions
	•	Add analytics tracking to monitor:
	•	Which ranks users drop off at
	•	Time between levels
	•	Challenge completion rate

✅ Optional: Add “Next Unlock” Preview:

On the gamification dashboard, show:
	•	Current level + title
	•	XP to next level
	•	Next reward preview (e.g., “Level 30 unlocks: New Badge”)
