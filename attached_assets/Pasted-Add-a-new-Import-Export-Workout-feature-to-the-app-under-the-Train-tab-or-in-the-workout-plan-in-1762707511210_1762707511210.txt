Add a new “Import / Export Workout” feature to the app under the Train tab or in the workout plan interface.

🔁 FEATURE: Import Workout Plan

Allow users to import a workout plan using any of the following methods:

Import Methods (user selects one):
	1.	Upload a File (.pdf, .docx, .txt, .json)
→ Extract exercises, sets, reps, notes
	2.	Paste Text
→ Freeform input like:
Day 1: Push – Bench Press 4x10, OHP 3x8…
	3.	Take a Photo of a Workout Plan
→ Use OCR to extract exercises from image
→ Ask user to confirm detected exercises
→ Map to database (AI auto-suggests or lets user search/correct)
	4.	Import From Coach (AI-generated or shared)
→ User enters a unique workout code or URL
→ Plan is fetched and loaded into their “Saved Workouts”

Post-Import Flow:
	•	Prompt user to name the workout
	•	Auto-tag by type (Push/Pull/Legs, Full Body, etc. using NLP)
	•	Save to “Load Saved Workouts” section
	•	Optionally edit imported plan manually
	•	Sync with progress tracker and XP system

📧 FEATURE: Export Workout as PDF

Allow any AI-generated or user-created workout to be exported as a clean, well-formatted PDF.

User chooses from export options:
	•	Entire Plan (with split, day breakdowns, notes)
	•	Single Workout Day
	•	Summary Only (exercise names + reps + sets)

Export Flow:
	•	Button on each workout: “Export as PDF”
	•	Option to email the PDF to user
	•	Or download directly to device
	•	Include branding, date created, and any badges/streak icons earned that week (optional)

⸻

⚙️ Technical / Functional Notes:
	•	All imported workouts should be parsed, mapped to existing exercise database, and saved in standard format
	•	If AI can’t match an exercise, prompt user to assign a known equivalent or add a custom one
	•	Sync all imported/exported workouts with:
	•	Saved Workouts
	•	Progress tracking
	•	XP system (bonus for importing plan and staying consistent)

⸻

🧠 Optional Add-On:

Add an AI Review Mode:
	•	After importing, let AI provide feedback:
“This plan is push-heavy — want to balance with more pull work?”
“No leg day detected — want to add one?”
“Volume looks high for a beginner. Adjust it?”
